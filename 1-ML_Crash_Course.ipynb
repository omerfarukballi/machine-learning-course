    "<h3>WHY USE MACHINE LEARNING?<br></h3>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Machine learning can be branched out into the following categories:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h5>Supervised Learning</h5>\n",
    "<h5>Unsupervised Learning<br><br><br></h5>\n",
    "Supervised Learning is where the data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data. For instance, a supervised learning algorithm for credit card fraud detection would take as input a set of recorded transactions. For each transaction, the program would predict if it is fraudulent or not.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h5>Regression:</h5>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In regression problems, we are trying to predict a continuous-valued output. Examples are:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "What is the housing price in Neo York?<br><br>\n",
    "What is the value of cryptocurrencies?<br><br>\n",
    "<h5>Classification:<br><br></h5>\n",
    "In classification problems, we are trying to predict a discrete number of values. Examples are:<br><br>\n",
    "Is this a picture of a human or a picture of an AI?<br><br>\n",
    "Is this email spam?<br><br>\n",
    "For a quick preview, we will show you an example of supervised learning.</p>"
